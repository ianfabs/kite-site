## This week

-   I Implemented resolvers for deleted and restoring containers
-   Developed the UI around this functionality
-   Worked on the styling of the front-end in respect to the containers and containers trash page.

## Next week

-   Change container deletion dialog to offer an option to permanently delete the container AND move it to the trash, instead of having to move it to the trash then delete it.
-   Help kyle with the css of the admin page, and fix an issue where the create user and users table merge together when the window is too small
-   Rewrite the resolvers for the containers page on the backend, create documentation for each one, and write documentation for each utility function.
-   Tidy up containers code.
-   Work on trash page CSS.
-   Look for bugs by trying to break the application.

## Roadblocks

Communication remains a huge roadblock for us, for some more so than others. It is disappointing to watch members of my team succeed in the functional aspects of their job, and not do – or try – as well in the aspects that deal with communicating appropriately, and efficiently. I don’t think this is something I, on my own, can change. This needs to be a team effort.
