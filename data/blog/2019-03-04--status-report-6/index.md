## This Week

I created three branches, two of which were completed and merged, and they were the following:

-   Integrate the Apollo client into the front-end. (Merged)
-   Integrate the vue-tour library into the front-end and create the tour. (Merged)
-   Integrate the vue-shortkey library, to add keyboard shortcuts into the app.

I also made several miscellaneous commits that did the following:

-   Add animation for container-deletion.
-   Improved said animation.
-   Made minor changes to the container API

## Next Week

I plan on making more improvements to the containers API, and finishing the vue-shortkey implementation. As well as exploring how to update our Redis cache system to update when changes are made to the database.

## Roadblocks

The redis modification will require exploration. I was also absent from a team meeting because I went home for the weekend. I asked them to call me, and no one did. So I asked someone to fill me in, to they all replied something along the lines of “we’re doing something with microservices”. Which doesn’t tell me much about what happened to be honest. Ineffective communication is still an issue, it’s getting better slowly though.
