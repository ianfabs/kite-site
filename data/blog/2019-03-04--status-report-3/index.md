## This Week

I created a basic grid-system for the front-end UI of the Containers page. I created Individual components for each portion of the UI. One for the grid, and one for the card itself. I created a separate git branch and then committed these changes there. Then I created a Pull Request, and had the team approve at our weekly meetings. 

## Next Week

I will create the files for the MongoDB Schemas and models. I will then implement them as reusable functions, to make writing server-side code easier. Then I will implement these functions into the containers portion of the API. This will be followed by testing of the API.

## Roadblocks

Keeping everyone on the same page consistently is a challenge. It gets hard when there is no direct leader, everyone has to come to a compromise on everything. This is especially difficult when everyone has good ideas. The meetings keep us all in check though, and more and more good work is getting done each week which is keeps me quite positive.
